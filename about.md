I grew up in Fresno, CA where I got my high school diploma at Clovis West High School in 2021. At the same time I served my community as a Boy Scout for seven years. Through that I was able to staff the National Youth Leadership Training that many scouts are sent to. After all of that I pursued a degree in computer science at California Baptist University. Since 2021 I have been working towards my major and learning to become an engineer. During my time in college I have worked for the school's Safety Services department to ensure campus security.
