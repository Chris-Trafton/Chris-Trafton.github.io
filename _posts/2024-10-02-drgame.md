Developed a game for two M5Core2s to play with eachother over Bluetooth Low Energy on a controller

- Both M5s connect to eachother over bluetooth, one acts as the host for the other to connect to
- Once connected the game starts
- Each payer will have their score at the top left, and their opponent's on the top right
- Inputs will move down the rows with the beat, when they get to the final row in the circles the player needs to input the movement
- Arrows refer to the four cardinal directions on the joystick, the letter refer to the face buttons, with the same orientation as an xbox controller
