Developed a game for two M5Core2s to play with eachother over Bluetooth Low Energy

- Both M5s connect to eachother over bluetooth, one acts as the host for the other to connect to
- Once connected the game starts, each player uses a dpad to move their blue dot
- The other M5 player shows up as the red dot

- If the dots hit each other the game ends
